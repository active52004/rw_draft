abstract = {An (\&Xscr;, \&Yscr;)-random system takes inputs X1, X2,...∈ \&Xscr; and generates, for each new input Xi, an output Yi ∈ \&Yscr;, depending probabilistically on X1,..., Xi and Y1,..., Yi-1. Many cryptographic systems like block ciphers, MAC-schemes, pseudorandom functions, etc., can be modeled as random systems, where in fact Yi often depends only on Xi, i.e., the system is stateless. The security proof of such a system (e.g. a block cipher) amounts to showing that it is indistinguishable from a certain perfect system (e.g. a random permutation). We propose a general framework for proving the indistinguishability of two random systems, based on the concept of the equivalence of two systems, conditioned on certain events. This abstraction demonstrates the common denominator among many security proofs in the literature, allows us to unify, simplify, generalize, and in some cases strengthen them, and opens the door to proving new indistinguishability results. We also propose the previously implicit concept of quasi-randomness and give an efficient construction of a quasi-random function which can be used as a building block in cryptographic systems based on pseudorandom functions},

We prove a result similar to Petrank and Rackoff's one by using decorrelation theory. This leads to a slightly improved result and a more compact proof.

abstract = {The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Message Authentication Code (MAC) is an authentication method which is widely used in practice. It is well known that the use of the CBC MAC for variable-length messages is not secure, and a few rules of thumb for the correct use of the CBC MAC are known by folklore. The first rigorous proof of the security of CBC MAC, when used on fixed-length messages, was given by M. Bellare et al. (1994). They also suggested variants of CBC MAC that handle variable-length messages but, in these variants, the length of the message has to be known in advance (i.e. before the message is processed). We study CBC authentication of real-time applications in which the length of the message is not known until the message ends, and furthermore, since the application is in real time, it is not possible to start processing the authentication until after the message ends. We first consider a variant of CBC MAC, that we call the Encrypted CBC MAC (EMAC), which handles messages of variable unknown lengths. Computing EMAC on a message is virtually as simple and as efficient as computing the standard CBC MAC on the message. We provide a rigorous proof that its security is implied by the security of the underlying block cipher. Next, we argue that the basic CBC MAC is secure when applied to a prefix-free message space. A message space can be made prefix-free by also authenticating the (usually hidden) last character which marks the end of the message},

More generally, we show how to construct a signature scheme with such properties based on the existence of a 'claw-free' pair of permutations - a potentially weaker assumption than the intractability of integer factorization. The new scheme is potentially practical: signing and verifying signatures are reasonably fast, and signatures are compact.},

abstract = {The Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation has been standardized by NIST to provide single-pass authenticated encryption. The GHASH authentication component of GCM belongs to a class of Wegman-Carter polynomial hashes that operate in the field GF(2<sup>128</sup>). We present message forgery attacks that are made possible by its extremely smooth-order multiplicative group which splits into 512 subgroups. GCM uses the same block cipher key <i>K</i> to both encrypt data and to derive the generator <i>H</i> of the authentication polynomial for GHASH. In present literature, only the trivial weak key <i>H</i> = 0 has been considered. We show that GHASH has much wider classes of weak keys in its 512 multiplicative subgroups, analyze some of their properties, and give experimental results on AES-GCM weak key search. Our attacks can be used not only to bypass message authentication with garbage but also to target specific plaintext bits if a polynomial MAC is used in conjunction with a stream cipher. These attacks can also be applied with varying efficiency to other polynomial hashes and MACs, depending on their field properties. Our findings show that especially the use of short polynomial-evaluation MACs should be avoided if the underlying field has a smooth multiplicative order.},

We first point out that a lemma, which is related to the upper bound on the probability of a counter collision, is invalid. Both the original privacy and authenticity proofs by the designers are based on the lemma. We further show that the observation can be translated into a distinguishing attack that invalidates the main part of the privacy proof. It turns out that the original security proofs of GCM contain a flaw, and hence the claimed security bounds are not justified. A very natural question is then whether the proofs can be repaired. We give an affirmative answer to the question by presenting new security bounds, both for privacy and authenticity. As a result, although the security bounds are larger than what were previously claimed, GCM maintains its provable security. We also show that, when the nonce length is restricted to 96 bits, GCM has better security bounds than a general case of variable length nonces.},

The first part presents new distinguishers of the MAC construction Alred and its specific instance Alpha-MAC based on AES. For the Alred construction, we first describe a general distinguishing attack which leads to a forgery attack directly with the complexity of the birthday attack. A 2-round collision differential path of Alpha-MAC is adopted to construct a new distinguisher with about 265.5 chosen messages and 265.5 queries. One of the most important results is to use this new distinguisher to recover the internal state, which is an equivalent subkey of Alpha-MAC. Moreover, our distinguisher on Alred construction can be applied to the MACs based on CBC and CFB encryption modes. The second part describes the first impossible differential attack on MACs-Pelican, MT-MAC-AES and PC-MAC-AES. Using the birthday attack, enough message pairs that produce the inner near-collision with some specific differences are detected, then the impossible differential attack on 4-round AES to the above mentioned MACs is performed. For Pelican, our attack recovers its internal state, which is an equivalent subkey. For MT-MAC-AES, the attack turns out to be a subkey recovery attack directly. The complexity of the two attacks is 285.5 chosen messages and 285.5 queries. For PC-MAC-AES, we recover its 256-bit key with 285.5 chosen messages and 2128 queries.},

When tweak T is obtained from tweak 5 by incrementing one if its numerical components, the cost to compute EKT(M) having already computed some EKS(M') is one blockcipher call plus a small and constant number of elementary machine operations. Our constructions work by associating to the ith coordinate of I an element $\alpha$i ∈ F2n* multiplying by $\alpha$i when one increments that component of the tweak. We illustrate the use of this approach by refining the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB and the message authentication code PMAC, yielding variants of these algorithms that are simpler and faster than the original schemes, and yet have simpler proofs. Our results bolster the thesis of Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner (2002) that a desirable approach for designing modes of operation is to start from a tweakable blockcipher. We elaborate on their idea, suggesting the kind of tweak space, usage-discipline, and blockcipher-based instantiations that give rise to simple and efficient modes},

@article{emac,
abstract = {The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Message Authentication Code (MAC) is an authentication method which is widely used in practice. It is well known that the use of the CBC MAC for variable-length messages is not secure, and a few rules of thumb for the correct use of the CBC MAC are known by folklore. The first rigorous proof of the security of CBC MAC, when used on fixed-length messages, was given by M. Bellare et al. (1994). They also suggested variants of CBC MAC that handle variable-length messages but, in these variants, the length of the message has to be known in advance (i.e. before the message is processed). We study CBC authentication of real-time applications in which the length of the message is not known until the message ends, and furthermore, since the application is in real time, it is not possible to start processing the authentication until after the message ends. We first consider a variant of CBC MAC, that we call the Encrypted CBC MAC (EMAC), which handles messages of variable unknown lengths. Computing EMAC on a message is virtually as simple and as efficient as computing the standard CBC MAC on the message. We provide a rigorous proof that its security is implied by the security of the underlying block cipher. Next, we argue that the basic CBC MAC is secure when applied to a prefix-free message space. A message space can be made prefix-free by also authenticating the (usually hidden) last character which marks the end of the message},

The tweak serves much the same purpose that an initialization vector does for CBC mode or that a nonce does for the OCB mode. Our proposal thus brings this feature down to the primitive block-cipher level, instead of incorporating it only at the higher modes-of-operation levels. We suggest that (1) tweakable block ciphers are easy to design, (2) the extra cost of making a block cipher "tweakable" is small, and (3) it is easier to design and prove modes of operation based on tweakable block ciphers},

@inproceedings{key_recover,
abstract = {This paper discusses key recovery and universal forgery attacks on several MAC algorithms based on universal hash functions. The attacks use a substantial number of verification queries but eventually allow for universal forgeries instead of existential or multiple forgeries. This means that the security of the algorithms completely collapses once a few forgeries are found. Some of these attacks start off by exploiting a weak key property, but turn out to become full-fledged divide and conquer attacks because of the specific structure of the universal hash functions considered. Partial information on a secret key can be exploited too, in the sense that it renders some key recovery attacks practical as soon as a few key bits are known. These results show that while universal hash functions offer provable security, high speeds and parallelism, their simple combinatorial properties make them less robust than conventional message authentication primitives.},

@article{survey,
abstract = {Since the 1980s, two approaches have been developed for analyzing security protocols. One of the approaches relies on a computational model that considers issues of complexity and probability. This approach captures a strong notion of security, guaranteed against all probabilistic polynomial-time attacks. The other approach relies on a symbolic model of protocol executions in which cryptographic primitives are treated as black boxes. Since the seminal work of Dolev and Yao, it has been realized that this latter approach enables significantly simpler and often automated proofs. However, the guarantees that it offers with respect to the more detailed computational models have been quite unclear. For more than 20 years the two approaches have coexisted but evolved mostly independently. Recently, significant research efforts attempt to develop paradigms for cryptographic systems analysis that combines the best of both worlds. There are two broad directions that have been followed. Computational soundness aims to establish sufficient conditions under which results obtained using symbolic models imply security under computational models. The direct approach aims to apply the principles and the techniques developed in the context of symbolic models directly to computational ones. In this paper we survey existing results along both of these directions. Our goal is to provide a rather complete summary that could act as a quick reference for researchers who want to contribute to the field, want to make use of existing results, or just want to get a better picture of what results already exist.},

@inproceedings{auto_verf,
abstract = {This paper presents the first automatic technique for proving not only protocols but also primitives in the exact security computational model. Automatic proofs of cryptographic protocols were up to now reserved to the Dolev-Yao model, which however makes quite strong assumptions on the primitives. On the other hand, with the proofs by reductions, in the complexity theoretic framework, more subtle security assumptions can be considered, but security analyses are manual. A process calculus is thus defined in order to take into account the probabilistic semantics of the computational model. It is already rich enough to describe all the usual security notions of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, as well as the basic computational assumptions. As an example, we illustrate the use of the new tool with the proof of a quite famous asymmetric primitive: unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (UF-CMA) of the full-domain hash signature scheme under the (trapdoor)-one-wayness of some permutations},
