abstract = {The use of cryptographic hash functions like MD5 or SHA-1 for message authentication has become a standard approach in many applications, particularly Internet security protocols. Though very easy to implement, these mechanisms are usually based on ad hoc techniques that lack a sound security analysis. We present new, simple, and practical constructions of message authentication schemes based on a cryptographic hash function. Our schemes, NMAC and HMAC, are proven to be secure as long as the underlying hash function has some reasonable cryptographic strengths. Moreover we show, in a quantitative way, that the schemes retain almost all the security of the underlying hash function. The performance of our schemes is essentially that of the underlying hash function. Moreover they use the hash function (or its compression function) as a black box, so that widely available library code or hardware can be used to implement them in a simple way, and replaceability of the underlying hash function is easily supported},

abstract = {Cryptographic protocols are successfully analyzed using formal methods. However, formal approaches usually consider the encryption schemes as black boxes and assume that an adversary cannot learn anything from an encrypted message except if he has the key. Such an assumption is too strong in general since some attacks exploit in a clever way the interaction between protocol rules and properties of cryptographic operators. Moreover, the executability of some protocols relies explicitly on some algebraic properties of cryptographic primitives such as commutative encryption. We give a list of some relevant algebraic properties of cryptographic operators, and for each of them, we provide examples of protocols or attacks using these properties. We also give an overview of the existing methods in formal approaches for analyzing cryptographic protocols},

Automatic proofs of cryptographic protocols were up to now reserved to the Dolev-Yao model, which however makes quite strong assumptions on the primitives. On the other hand, with the proofs by reductions, in the complexity theoretic framework, more subtle security assumptions can be considered, but security analyses are manual. A process calculus is thus defined in order to take into account the probabilistic semantics of the computational model. It is already rich enough to describe all the usual security notions of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, as well as the basic computational assumptions. As an example, we illustrate the use of the new tool with the proof of a quite famous asymmetric primitive: unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (UF-CMA) of the full-domain hash signature scheme under the (trapdoor)-one-wayness of some permutations},

abstract = {Multiprocessor computer systems are currently widely used in commercial settings to run critical applications. These applications often operate on sensitive data such as customer records, credit card numbers, and financial data. As a result, these systems are the frequent targets of attacks because of the potentially significant gain an attacker could obtain from stealing or tampering with such data. This provides strong motivation to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data in commercial multiprocessor systems through architectural support. Architectural support is able to protect against software-based attacks, and is necessary to protect against hardware-based attacks. In this work, we propose architectural mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality and integrity in Distributed Shared Memory multiprocessors which utilize a point-to-point based interconnection network. Our approach improves upon previous work in this area, mainly in the fact that our approach reduces performance overheads by significantly reducing the amount of cryptographic operations required. Evaluation results show that our approach can protect data confidentiality and integrity in a 16-processor DSM system with an average overhead of 1.6\% and a maximum of only 7\% across all SPLASH-2 applications.},

abstract = {This paper develops several new techniques of cryptanalyzing MACs based on block ciphers, and is divided into two parts. The first part presents new distinguishers of the MAC construction Alred and its specific instance Alpha-MAC based on AES. For the Alred construction, we first describe a general distinguishing attack which leads to a forgery attack directly with the complexity of the birthday attack. A 2-round collision differential path of Alpha-MAC is adopted to construct a new distinguisher with about 265.5 chosen messages and 265.5 queries. One of the most important results is to use this new distinguisher to recover the internal state, which is an equivalent subkey of Alpha-MAC. Moreover, our distinguisher on Alred construction can be applied to the MACs based on CBC and CFB encryption modes. The second part describes the first impossible differential attack on MACs-Pelican, MT-MAC-AES and PC-MAC-AES. Using the birthday attack, enough message pairs that produce the inner near-collision with some specific differences are detected, then the impossible differential attack on 4-round AES to the above mentioned MACs is performed. For Pelican, our attack recovers its internal state, which is an equivalent subkey. For MT-MAC-AES, the attack turns out to be a subkey recovery attack directly. The complexity of the two attacks is 285.5 chosen messages and 285.5 queries. For PC-MAC-AES, we recover its 256-bit key with 285.5 chosen messages and 2128 queries.},

abstract = {Protection and security are becoming essential requirements in commercial servers. In this paper, we present a fast and efficient method for providing secure memory and cache-to-cache communications in shared memory multiprocessor systems that are becoming enormously popular in designing servers for various applications. Since our scheme is independent of underlying interconnects and cache coherence protocols, we refer to it as Interconnects-Independent Security Enhanced Shared Memory Multiprocessor Systems (I<sup>2</sup>SEMS). The main challenge in designing I2SEMS is how to precompute keystreams in a timely manner, which is critical to minimize performance overhead. We achieve this goal by adopting a single system-wide Global Counter Controller (GCC) and three additional components for each processor: a keystream queue, a keystream cache, and a keystream pool. The GCC assigns a unique range of counters as a way to help processors precompute the counters' keystreams. We have implemented I <sup>2</sup>SEMS using Simics with Wisconsin multifacet General Execution-driven Multiprocessor Simulator (GEMS). We tested our design with SPLASH-2 benchmarks on up to 16-processor shared memory multiprocessor systems. Simulation results show that the overall performance slowdown is 4\% on average and the keystream hit rate is as high as 78\%. The stable keystream hit rate shows that I <sup>2</sup>SEMS works well with both memory-read and memory-write dominant applications. Similar to the conventional cache, a large keystream pool size is beneficial to high hit rates. \{\&\}copy; 2007 IEEE.},

Embedded computer systems are subjected to both software and physical attacks aimed at subverting system operation, extracting key secrets, or intellectual property theft. We propose several cost-effective architectural extensions suitable for mid-range to high-end embedded processors. These extensions ensure the integrity and confidentiality of both instructions and data, introducing low performance overhead (1.86\% for instructions and 14.9\% for data).

abstract = {Security continues to be an increasingly important concern in the design of modern systems. Many systems may have security requirements such as protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data and code stored in the system, ensuring integrity of computations, or preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Making security guarantees has become even harder with the emergence of hardware attacks where the attacker has physical access to the system and can bypass any software security mechanisms employed. To this end, researchers have proposed Secure Processor architectures that provide protection against hardware attacks using platform features. In this paper, we analyze three of the currently proposed secure uniprocessor designs in terms of their security, complexity of hardware required and performance overheads: eXecute Only Memory (XOM), Counter mode encryption and Merkle tree based authentication, and Address Independent Seed Encryption and Bonsai Merkle Tree based authentication. We then provide a discussion on the issues in securing multiprocessor systems and survey one design each for Shared Memory Multiprocessors and Distributed Shared Memory Multiprocessors. Finally, we discuss future directions in Secure Processor research which have largely been ignored forming the weakest link in the security afforded by the proposed schemes, namely, Secure booting and Secure configuration. We identify potential issues which can serve to form the foundation of further research in secure processors. \{\&\}copy; 2010 Springer.},

abstract = {This paper provides a unified framework for improving PRF (pseudorandom function) advantages of several popular MACs (message authentication codes) based on a blockcipher modeled as RP (random permutation). In many known MACs, the inputs of the underlying blockcipher are denned to be some deterministic affine functions of previously computed outputs of the blockcipher. Keeping the similarity in mind, a class of ADEs (affine domain extensions) and a wide subclass of SADEs (secure ADEs) are introduced in the paper which contain following constructions C = CBC-MAC, GCBC*, OMAC, PMAC. We prove that all SADEs have PRF advantages O(tq/2<sup>n</sup> + N(t,q)/2<sup>n</sup>) where t is the total number of blockcipher computations needed for all q queries and N(t, q) is a parameter denned in the paper. The PRF advantage of any SADE is O(t<sup>2</sup>/2<sup>n</sup>) as we can show that N(t,q) \{\&\}les; (<sub>2</sub><sup>t</sup>). Moreover, N(t,q) = O(tq) for all members of C and hence these MACs have improved advantages O(tq/2<sup>n</sup>).

abstract = {Since the 1980s, two approaches have been developed for analyzing security protocols. One of the approaches relies on a computational model that considers issues of complexity and probability. This approach captures a strong notion of security, guaranteed against all probabilistic polynomial-time attacks. The other approach relies on a symbolic model of protocol executions in which cryptographic primitives are treated as black boxes. Since the seminal work of Dolev and Yao, it has been realized that this latter approach enables significantly simpler and often automated proofs. However, the guarantees that it offers with respect to the more detailed computational models have been quite unclear. For more than 20 years the two approaches have coexisted but evolved mostly independently. Recently, significant research efforts attempt to develop paradigms for cryptographic systems analysis that combines the best of both worlds. There are two broad directions that have been followed. Computational soundness aims to establish sufficient conditions under which results obtained using symbolic models imply security under computational models. The direct approach aims to apply the principles and the techniques developed in the context of symbolic models directly to computational ones. In this paper we survey existing results along both of these directions. Our goal is to provide a rather complete summary that could act as a quick reference for researchers who want to contribute to the field, want to make use of existing results, or just want to get a better picture of what results already exist.},

abstract = {Recently there is a growing effort in both the architecture and the security community to create a hardware solution for authenticating system memory. As shown in the previous work, hardware-based memory authentication becomes a vital component for creating future trusted computing environments and digital rights protection. Almost all these prior work have focused on authenticating memory exclusively owned by a single processing element. However, in today's computing platforms, memory is often shared by multiple processing elements that support a shared system memory with a snooping cache coherence protocol. Authenticating shared memory is a new challenge to memory protection. In this paper, we present a secure and fast architecture for authenticating shared memory. In terms of incorporating memory authentication into the processor pipeline, we propose a new scheme called authentication speculative execution. Unlike the prior approaches, our scheme does not compromise security for performance. The novel ASE scheme is not only secure as it is combined with a onetime-pad (OTP) based memory encryption but also efficient to tolerate authentication latency by executing unauthenticated instructions speculatively. Results using modified RSIM running SPLASH2 benchmark show only 5\% overhead in performance on dual and quad processor platforms. Furthermore, ASE shows 80\% better performance on average over conservative nonspeculative execution based authentication schemes. The scheme is of practical use for both multiprocessor systems and uni-processor systems where memory is shared by one main processor and other co-processors on the system bus},

abstract = {Exhibits several new classes of hash functions with certain desirable properties, and introduce two novel applications for hashing which make use of these functions. One class contains a small number of functions, yet is almost universal. If the functions hash <i>n</i>-bit long names into <i>m</i>-bit indices, then specifying a member of the class requires only <i>O</i>((<i>m</i>+log<sub>2</sub> log<sub>2</sub>(<i>n</i>)).log<sub>2</sub>(<i>n</i>)) bits as compared to <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) bits for earlier techniques. For long names, this is about a factor of <i>m</i> larger than the lower bound of <i>m</i>+log<sub>2</sub> <i>n</i>-log<sub>2</sub> <i>m</i> bits. An application of this class is a provably secure authentication technique for sending messages over insecure lines. A second class of functions satisfies a much stronger property than universal. The authors present the application of testing sets for equality. The authentication technique allows the receiver to be certain that a message is genuine. An `enemy'-even one with infinite computer resources-cannot forge or modify a message without detection. The set equality technique allows operations including `add member to set', `delete member from set' and `test two sets for equality' to be performed in expected constant time and with less than a specified probability of error},

Unfortunately, it is not forgery-secure over an arbitrary domain. There are several secure variants of CBC-MAC, among which OMAC is a widely-used candidate. To authenticate an s-block message, OMAC costs (s + 1) block cipher encryptions (one of these is a zero block encryption), and only one block cipher key is used. In this paper, we propose two secure and efficient variants of CBC-MAC: namely, GCBC1 and GCBC2. Our constructions cost only s block cipher encryptions to authenticate an s-block message, for all s \&ges; 2. Moreover, GCBC2 needs only one block cipher encryption for almost all single block messages, and for all other single block messages, it costs two block cipher encryptions.

In particular, we have provided an unified prf-security analysis of CBC-type constructions, e.g., XCBC, TMAC and our proposals GCBC1 and GCBC2.},

We prove a result similar to Petrank and Rackoff's one by using decorrelation theory. This leads to a slightly improved result and a more compact proof.

These modes detect encrypted-message forgeries at low cost in performance, power, and implementation, and preserve both message secrecy and integrity in a single pass over the message data. Their performance and security scale directly with those of the underlying block cipher function.

We formalize and investigate this authenticated-encryption with associated-data (AEAD) problem. Though the problem has long been addressed in cryptographic practice, it was never provided a definition or even a name. We do this, and go on to look at efficient solutions for AEAD, both in general and for the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB. For the general setting we study two simple ways to turn an authenticated-encryption scheme that does not support associated-data into one that does: nonce stealing and ciphertext translation. For the case of OCB we construct an AEAD-scheme by combining OCB and the pseudorandom function PMAC, using the same key for both algorithms. We prove that, despite "interaction" between the two schemes when using a common key, the combination is sound. We also consider achieving AEAD by the generic composition of a nonce-based, privacy-only encryption scheme and a pseudorandom function.},

In particular, the high demands for quality and reliability for embedded systems have led to complementary quality assurance efforts: hardware engineers have developed techniques for dynamic verification in terms of co-simulation, which, in particular, addresses the different nature of hardware and software components. Thus these techniques are tailored for the transactional level, which comprises dedicated models for the hardware and the software parts. On the other hand, there is a bulk of work on formal verification techniques, which typically address higher levels of abstraction. These techniques are exhaustive in the sense that they cover all the infinite possible paths of their models, however at the price of neglecting many of the low-level aspects treated by co-simulation. It is the goal of this paper to increase the mutual understanding between these communities and to animate research at this exciting borderline},

As a result, researchers have investigated hardware encryption and authentication mechanisms as a means of addressing this security concern. Unfortunately, no such techniques have been investigated for Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) multiprocessors, and previously proposed techniques for uni-processor and Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems cannot be directly used for DSMs. This work is the first to examine the issues involved in protecting secrecy and integrity of data in DSM systems. We first derive security requirements for processor-processor communication in DSMs, and find that different types of coherence messages need different protection. Then we propose and evaluate techniques to provide efficient encryption and authentication of the data in DSM systems. Our simulation results using SPLASH-2 benchmarks show that the execution time overhead for our three proposed approaches is small and ranges from 6\% to 8\% on a 16-processor DSM system, relative to a similar DSM without support for data secrecy and integrity.

abstract = {The abstraction of cryptographic operations by term algebras, called Dolev-Yao models, is essential in almost all tool-supported methods for proving security protocols. Recently significant progress was made in proving that Dolev-Yao models can be sound with respect to actual cryptographic realizations and security definitions. The strongest results show this in the sense of blackbox reactive simulatability (BRSIM)/UC, a notion that essentially means the preservation of arbitrary security properties under arbitrary active attacks and in arbitrary protocol environments, with only small changes to the Dolev-Yao models and natural implementations. However, these results are so far restricted to core cryptographic systems like encryption and signatures. Typical modern tools and complexity results around Dolev-Yao models also allow operations with more algebraic properties, in particular XOR because of its clear structure and cryptographic usefulness. We show that it is not possible to extend the strong BRSIM/UC results to XOR, at least not with remotely the same generality and naturalness as for the core cryptographic systems. We also show that for every potential soundness result for XOR with secrecy implications, one significant change to typical Dolev-Yao models must be made. On the positive side, we show the soundness of a rather general Dolev-Yao model with XOR and its realization in the sense of BRSIM/UC under passive attacks.},

abstract = {The bus between the System on Chip (SoC) and the external memory is one of the weakest points of computer systems: an adversary can easily probe this bus in order to read private data (data confidentiality concern) or to inject data (data integrity concern). The conventional way to protect data against such attacks and to ensure data confidentiality and integrity is to implement two dedicated engines: one performing data encryption and another data authentication. This approach, while secure, prevents parallelizability of the underlying computations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Block-Level Added Redundancy Explicit Authentication (BL-AREA) and we describe a Parallelized Encryption and Integrity Checking Engine (PE-ICE) based on this concept. BL-AREA and PE-ICE have been designed to provide an effective solution to ensure both security services while allowing for full parallelization on processor read and write operations and optimizing the hardware resources. Compared to standard encryption which ensures only confidentiality, we show that PE-ICE additionally guarantees code and data integrity for less than 4\% of run-time performance overhead. \{\&\}copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Randomness test suites constitute an essential component within the process of assessing random number generators in view of determining their suitability for a specific application. Evaluating the randomness quality of random numbers sequences produced by a given generator is not an easy task considering that no finite set of statistical tests can assure perfect randomness, instead each test attempts to rule out sequences that show deviation from perfect randomness by means of certain statistical properties. This is the reason why several batteries of statistical tests are applied to increase the confidence in the selected generator. Therefore, in the present context of constantly increasing volumes of random data that need to be tested, special importance has to be given to the performance of the statistical test suites. Our work enrolls in this direction and this paper presents the results on improving the well known NIST Statistical Test Suite (STS) by introducing parallelism and a paradigm shift towards byte processing delivering a design that is more suitable for today's multicore architectures. Experimental results show a very significant speedup of up to 103 times compared to the original version. \&copy; 2010 IEEE.},

In this paper, we complement that analysis, showing that one can expect a reasonable security level even when attackers try to explore such collisions. More specifically, we use the game-playing technique to formally evaluate the security of one Alred instance, Marvin, bounding its security in a quantitative manner; the security analysis is in the concrete-security paradigm.

abstract = {Protection and security are becoming essential requirements in commercial servers. To provide secure memory and cache-to-cache communications, we presented Interconnect-Independent Security Enhanced Shared Memory Multiprocessor System (I<sup>2</sup>SEMS), mainly focusing on how to manage a global counter to encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate data messages with little performance overhead. However, I<sup>2</sup>SEMS was vulnerable to replay attacks on data messages and integrity attacks on control and counter messages. This paper proposes three authentication schemes to remove those security vulnerabilities. First, we prevent replay attacks on data messages by inserting Request Counter (RC) into request messages. Second, we also use RC to detect integrity attacks on control messages. Third, we propose a new counter, referred to as GCC Counter (GC), to protect the global counter messages. We simulated our design with SPLASH-2 benchmarks on up to 16-processor shared memory multiprocessor systems by using Simics with Wisconsin multifacet General Execution-driven Multiprocessor Simulator (GEMS). Simulation results show that the overall performance slowdown is 4 percent on average with the highest keystream hit rate of 78 percent.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the security proofs of GCM (Galois/Counter Mode of Operation). We first point out that a lemma, which is related to the upper bound on the probability of a counter collision, is invalid. Both the original privacy and authenticity proofs by the designers are based on the lemma. We further show that the observation can be translated into a distinguishing attack that invalidates the main part of the privacy proof. It turns out that the original security proofs of GCM contain a flaw, and hence the claimed security bounds are not justified. A very natural question is then whether the proofs can be repaired. We give an affirmative answer to the question by presenting new security bounds, both for privacy and authenticity. As a result, although the security bounds are larger than what were previously claimed, GCM maintains its provable security. We also show that, when the nonce length is restricted to 96 bits, GCM has better security bounds than a general case of variable length nonces.},

abstract = {Traditionally, symmetric-key message authentication codes (MACs) are easily built from pseudorandom functions (PRFs). In this work we propose a wide variety of other approaches to building efficient MACs, without going through a PRF first. In particular, unlike deterministic PRF-based MACs, where each message has a unique valid tag, we give a number of probabilistic MAC constructions from various other primitives/assumptions. Our main results are summarized as follows: (a) We show several new probabilistic MAC constructions from a variety of general assumptions, including CCA-secure encryption, Hash Proof Systems and key-homomorphic weak PRFs. By instantiating these frameworks under concrete number theoretic assumptions, we get several schemes which are more efficient than just using a state-of-the-art PRF instantiation under the corresponding assumption. (b) For probabilistic MACs, unlike deterministic ones, unforgeability against a chosen message attack (uf-cma) alone does not imply security if the adversary can additionally make verification queries (uf-cmva). We give an efficient generic transformation from any uf-cma secure MAC which is “message-hiding” into a uf-cmva secure MAC. This resolves the main open problem of Kiltz et al. from Eurocrypt'11; By using our transformation on their constructions, we get the first efficient MACs from the LPN assumption. (c) While all our new MAC constructions immediately give efficient actively secure, two-round symmetric-key identification schemes, we also show a very simple, three-round actively secure identification protocol from any weak PRF. In particular, the resulting protocol is much more efficient than the trivial approach of building a regular PRF from a weak PRF.},

In this approach, software tampering occurs if the system can enter a state where one model is inconsistent with the other. In performing the verification, we detected an replay attack scenario and were able to verify the security of our solution to the problem.

This allows us to define cryptographic constructions, effective adversaries, security notions, computational assumptions, game transformations, and game-based security proofs in the unified framework provided by CSLR.

abstract = {A common trend in applications of block ciphers over the past decades has been to employ block ciphers as one piece of a \&ldquo;mode of operation\&rdquo;-possibly, a way to make a secure symmetric-key cryptosystem, but more generally, any cryptographic application. Most of the time, these modes of operation use a wide variety of techniques to achieve a subgoal necessary for their main goal: instantiation of \&ldquo;essentially different\&rdquo; instances of the block cipher. We formalize a cryptographic primitive, the "tweakable block cipher." Such a cipher has not only the usual inputs-message and cryptographic key-but also a third input, the "tweak." The tweak serves much the same purpose that an initialization vector does for CBC mode or that a nonce does for OCB mode. Our abstraction brings this feature down to the primitive block-cipher level, instead of incorporating it only at the higher modes-of-operation levels. We suggest that (1) tweakable block ciphers are easy to design, (2) the extra cost of making a block cipher "tweakable" is small, and (3) it is easier to design and prove the security of applications of block ciphers that need this variability using tweakable block ciphers.},

The GHASH authentication component of GCM belongs to a class of Wegman-Carter polynomial hashes that operate in the field GF(2<sup>128</sup>). We present message forgery attacks that are made possible by its extremely smooth-order multiplicative group which splits into 512 subgroups. GCM uses the same block cipher key <i>K</i> to both encrypt data and to derive the generator <i>H</i> of the authentication polynomial for GHASH. In present literature, only the trivial weak key <i>H</i> = 0 has been considered. We show that GHASH has much wider classes of weak keys in its 512 multiplicative subgroups, analyze some of their properties, and give experimental results on AES-GCM weak key search. Our attacks can be used not only to bypass message authentication with garbage but also to target specific plaintext bits if a polynomial MAC is used in conjunction with a stream cipher. These attacks can also be applied with varying efficiency to other polynomial hashes and MACs, depending on their field properties. Our findings show that especially the use of short polynomial-evaluation MACs should be avoided if the underlying field has a smooth multiplicative order.},

abstract = {This paper presents two types of cryptanalysis on a Merkle-Damg\aa rd hash based MAC, which computes a MAC value of a message M by Hash(K||\&lscr;||M) with a shared key K and the message length \&lscr;. This construction is often called LPMAC. Firstly, we present a distinguishing-H attack against LPMAC instantiating any narrow-pipe Merkle-Damg\aa rd hash function with O(2n/2) queries, which indicates the incorrectness of the widely believed assumption that LPMAC instantiating a secure hash function should resist the distinguishing-H attack up to 2n queries. In fact, all of the previous distinguishing-H attacks considered dedicated attacks depending on the underlying hash algorithm, and most of the cases, reduced rounds were attacked with a complexity between 2n/2 and 2n . Because it works in generic, our attack updates these results, namely full rounds are attacked with O(2n/2) complexity. Secondly, we show that an even stronger attack, which is a powerful form of an almost universal forgery attack, can be performed on LPMAC. In this setting, attackers can modify the first several message-blocks of a given message and aim to recover an internal state and forge the MAC value. For any narrow-pipe Merkle-Damg\aa rd hash function, our attack can be performed with O(2n/2) queries. These results show that the length prepending scheme is not enough to achieve a secure MAC.},

abstract = {An (\&Xscr;, \&Yscr;)-random system takes inputs X1, X2,...∈ \&Xscr; and generates, for each new input Xi, an output Yi ∈ \&Yscr;, depending probabilistically on X1,..., Xi and Y1,..., Yi-1. Many cryptographic systems like block ciphers, MAC-schemes, pseudorandom functions, etc., can be modeled as random systems, where in fact Yi often depends only on Xi, i.e., the system is stateless. The security proof of such a system (e.g. a block cipher) amounts to showing that it is indistinguishable from a certain perfect system (e.g. a random permutation). We propose a general framework for proving the indistinguishability of two random systems, based on the concept of the equivalence of two systems, conditioned on certain events. This abstraction demonstrates the common denominator among many security proofs in the literature, allows us to unify, simplify, generalize, and in some cases strengthen them, and opens the door to proving new indistinguishability results. We also propose the previously implicit concept of quasi-randomness and give an efficient construction of a quasi-random function which can be used as a building block in cryptographic systems based on pseudorandom functions},

We consider two possible notions of authenticity for such schemes, namely integrity of plaintexts and integrity of ciphertexts, and relate them, when coupled with IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack), to the standard notions of privacy IND-CCA and NM-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attack and nonmalleability under chosen-plaintext attack) by presenting implications and separations between all notions considered. We then analyze the security of authenticated encryption schemes designed by "generic composition," meaning making black-box use of a given symmetric encryption scheme and a given MAC. Three composition methods are considered, namely Encrypt-and-MAC, MAC-then-encrypt, and Encrypt-then-MAC. For each of these and for each notion of security, we indicate whether or not the resulting scheme meets the notion in question assuming that the given symmetric encryption scheme is secure against chosen-plaintext attack and the given MAC is unforgeable under chosen-message attack.

In this paper we describe an efficient hardware mechanism that protects software integrity and guarantees software confidentiality. To provide software integrity, each instruction block is signed during program installation with a cryptographically secure signature. The signatures embedded in the code are verified during program execution. Software confidentiality is provided by encrypting instruction blocks. To achieve low performance overhead, the proposed mechanism combines several architectural enhancements: a variation of one-time-pad encryption, parallelizable signatures, and conditional execution of unverified instructions. A relatively high memory overhead due to embedded signatures can be reduced by protecting multiple instruction blocks with one signature, with minimal effects on complexity and performance overhead.},

abstract = {Today, the embedded systems field is growing rapidly, ranging from low-end systems such as cellular phones, PDAs, smart cards to high-end systems such as gateways, firewalls, storage servers, and web server. Security of embedded system becomes a paramount issue in embedded system design. Compared to an embedded system's functionality and other design metric (e.g., area, performance, power), security is currently specified by system architects in a vague and imprecise manner. This paper proposes a fuzzy integrated security evaluation method based on man-computer combined data collection and fuzzy expert evaluation in Delphi method. The method could reduce the subjectivity of expert evaluation and alleviate the difficulty of data collection and makes possible a better combination of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Firstly, the hierarchy structure model of embedded system security is constructed. Secondly, according to data collected and the evaluation comment of each expert, the subjection degree matrix is constructed. Finally, a new concept of \{\&\}ldquo;degree of assurance\{\&\}rdquo; is presented for the quantificational evaluation of embedded system security. In this paper a study of a wireless biometric authentication device is also shown. The case illustrates that the method can be easily used and its results conform to the actual situation.},

Today, a system needs two independent mechanisms in order to protect the memory integrity from both physical attacks and random errors. Integrity verification schemes detect malicious tampering of memory while error correcting codes (ECC) detect and correct random errors. IVEC enables both detection of malicious attacks for security and correction of random errors for reliability at the same time by extending the integrity verification techniques. Analytical and experimental studies show that IVEC can correct single-bit errors and even multibit errors from one DRAM chip within a cache block read without any additional ECC bits, when the integrity verification is also required for security, effectively removing the memory and bandwidth overheads (12.5\%) of typical ECC schemes. Alternatively, with parity bits, IVEC can provide even stronger error correction capabilities comparable to the traditional chip-kill correct, still with less overheads. For both cases, IVEC can use standard non-ECC DIMMs. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract = {The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Message Authentication Code (MAC) is an authentication method which is widely used in practice. It is well known that the use of the CBC MAC for variable-length messages is not secure, and a few rules of thumb for the correct use of the CBC MAC are known by folklore. The first rigorous proof of the security of CBC MAC, when used on fixed-length messages, was given by M. Bellare et al. (1994). They also suggested variants of CBC MAC that handle variable-length messages but, in these variants, the length of the message has to be known in advance (i.e. before the message is processed). We study CBC authentication of real-time applications in which the length of the message is not known until the message ends, and furthermore, since the application is in real time, it is not possible to start processing the authentication until after the message ends. We first consider a variant of CBC MAC, that we call the Encrypted CBC MAC (EMAC), which handles messages of variable unknown lengths. Computing EMAC on a message is virtually as simple and as efficient as computing the standard CBC MAC on the message. We provide a rigorous proof that its security is implied by the security of the underlying block cipher. Next, we argue that the basic CBC MAC is secure when applied to a prefix-free message space. A message space can be made prefix-free by also authenticating the (usually hidden) last character which marks the end of the message},

This paper studies the hardware implementation of a form of execute-only memory (XOM) that allows instructions stored in memory to be executed but not otherwise manipulated. To support XOM code we use a machine that supports internal compartments - a process in one compartment cannot read data from another compartment. All data that leaves the machine is encrypted, since we assume external memory is not secure. The design of this machine poses some interesting trade-offs between security, efficiency, and flexibility. We explore some of the potential security issues as one pushes the machine to become more efficient and flexible. Although security carries a performance penalty, our analysis indicates that it is possible to create a normal multi-tasking machine where nearly all applications can be run in XOM mode. While a virtual XOM machine is possible, the underlying hardware needs to support a unique private key, private memory, and traps on cache misses. For efficient operation, hardware assist to provide fast symmetric ciphers is also required.},

abstract = {Replay attacks are often the most costly attacks to thwart when dealing with off-chip memory integrity. With a trusted system-on-chip, the existing countermeasures against replay require a large amount of on-chip memory to provide tamper-proof storage for metadata such as hash values or nonces. Tree-based strategies can be deployed to reduce this unacceptable overhead; for example, the well-known Merkle tree technique decreases this overhead to a single hash value. However, it comes at the cost of performance-killing characteristics for embedded systems - e.g. non-parallelizable hash computations on tree updates. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution: the tamper-evident counter tree (TEC-Tree). It allows for tamper-evident off-chip storage of the nonces involved in a replay countermeasure; TEC-Tree parallelizes the computations involved in both the authentication and tree update processes. Moreover, because our tree relies on block encryption, it provides data confidentiality at no extra cost. TEC-Tree is a deployable solution for memory integrity, with low performance hit and hardware cost.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel mode of operation of compression functions, intended for dedicated use as a message authentication code (MAC.) The new approach is faster than the well-known Merkle-Damgard iteration; more precisely, it is (1+c/b)-times as fast as the classical Merkle-Damgard hashing when applied to a compression function h:\{0,1\}c+b→\{0,1\}c. Our construction provides a single-key MAC with provable security; we show that the proposed scheme yields a PRF(pseudo-random function)-based MAC on the assumption that the underlying compression function h satisfies certain PRF properties. Thus our method offers a way to process data more efficiently than the conventional HMAC without losing formal proofs of security. Our design also takes into account usage with prospective compression functions; that is, those compression functions h with relatively weighty load and relatively large c (i.e., "wide-pipe") greatly benefit from the improved performance by our mode of operation.},

Verifying the integrity of memory contents is a crucial security service that these platforms must proviDe since an adversary able to corrupt the memory space can affect the computations performed by the platform. After a description of the active attacks that threaten memory integrity, this paper surveys existing cryptographic techniques - namely integrity trees - allowing for memory authentication. The strategies proposed in the literature for implementing such trees on general-purpose computing platforms are presented, along with their complexity. This paper also discusses the effect of a potentially compromised Operating System (OS) on computing platforms requiring memory authentication and describes an architecture recently proposed to proviDe this security service despite an untrusted OS. Existing techniques for memory authentication that are not based on trees are described and their performance/ ecurity trade-off is discussed. While this paper focuses on memory authentication for uniprocessor platforms, we also discuss the security issues that arise when considering data authentication in symmetric multiprocessor (shared memory) systems. \{\&\}copy;Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new high-entropy digital element suitable for True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) embedded in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The original idea behind this principle lies in the randomness extraction on oscillatory trajectory when a bi-stable circuit is resolving a metastable event. Although such phenomenon is well known in the field of synchronization flip-flops, this feature has not been applied for TRNG designs. We propose a new bi-stable structure Transition Effect Ring Oscillator (TERO) where oscillatory phase can be forced on demand and be reliably synthesized in FPGA. Randomness is represented as a variance of the TERO oscillations number counted after each excitation. Variance is highly dependent on the internal noise of logic cells and can be used easily for reliable instant inner testing of each generated bit. Our proposed mathematical model, simulations and hardware experiments show that TERO is significantly more sensitive to intrinsic noise in FPGA logic cells and less sensitive to global perturbations than a ring oscillator composed from the same elements. The experimental TERO-based TRNG passes NIST 800-22 tests.},

abstract = {Security continues to be an increasingly important concern in the design of modern systems. Many systems may have security requirements such as protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data and code stored in the system, ensuring integrity of computations, or preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Making security guarantees has become even harder with the emergence of hardware attacks where the attacker has physical access to the system and can bypass any software security mechanisms employed. To this end, researchers have proposed Secure Processor architectures that provide protection against hardware attacks using platform features. In this paper, we analyze three of the currently proposed secure uniprocessor designs in terms of their security, complexity of hardware required and performance overheads: eXecute Only Memory (XOM), Counter mode encryption and Merkle tree based authentication, and Address Independent Seed Encryption and Bonsai Merkle Tree based authentication. We then provide a discussion on the issues in securing multiprocessor systems and survey one design each for Shared Memory Multiprocessors and Distributed Shared Memory Multiprocessors. Finally, we discuss future directions in Secure Processor research which have largely been ignored forming the weakest link in the security afforded by the proposed schemes, namely, Secure booting and Secure configuration. We identify potential issues which can serve to form the foundation of further research in secure processors.},

Our results indicate that the split-counter scheme has a negligible overhead even with a small (32KB) counter cache and using only eight counter bits per data block. The combined encryption/authentication scheme has an IPC overhead of 5\% on average across SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks, which is a significant improvement over the 20\% overhead of existing encryption/authentication schemes},

The constructions are mainly intended for message authentication in systems implementing stream cipher encryption and are suitable for other applications as well. The proposed hash functions are implemented through linear feedback shift registers and therefore attractive for hardware applications. As an example, a single 64 bit LFSR is used to authenticate 1 Gbit of information with a failure probability of less than 2-30. One of the constructions is the cryptographic version of the well known cyclic redundancy codes (CRC); the other is based on Toeplitz hashing where the matrix entries are generated by a LFSR. The later construction achieves essentially the same hashing and authentication strength of a completely random matrix but at a substantially lower cost in randomness, key size and implementation complexity. Of independent interest is our characterization of the properties required from a family of hash functions in order to be secure for authentication when combined with a (secure) stream cipher},

Instead, the security of UMAC is rigorously proven, in the sense of giving exact and quantitatively strong results which demonstrate an inability to forge UMAC-authenticated messages assuming an inability to break the underlying cryptographic primitive. Unlike conventional, inherently serial MAC, UMAC is parallelizable, and will have ever-faster implementation speeds as machines offer up increasing amounts of parallelism.

When tweak T is obtained from tweak 5 by incrementing one if its numerical components, the cost to compute EKT(M) having already computed some EKS(M') is one blockcipher call plus a small and constant number of elementary machine operations. Our constructions work by associating to the ith coordinate of I an element $\alpha$i ∈ F2n* multiplying by $\alpha$i when one increments that component of the tweak. We illustrate the use of this approach by refining the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB and the message authentication code PMAC, yielding variants of these algorithms that are simpler and faster than the original schemes, and yet have simpler proofs. Our results bolster the thesis of Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner (2002) that a desirable approach for designing modes of operation is to start from a tweakable blockcipher.

Embedded systems are pervasive and often mission-critical, therefore, they must be highly trustworthy. Trustworthy embedded systems require extensive verification. The close interactions between hardware and software of embedded systems demand co-verification. Due to their diverse applications and often strict physical constraints, embedded systems are increasingly component-based and include only the necessary components for their missions. In our approach, a component model for embedded systems which unifies the concepts of hardware IPs (i.e., hardware components) and software components is defined. Hardware and software components are verified as they are developed bottom-up. Whole systems are co-verified as they are developed top-down. Interactions of bottom-up and top-down verification are exploited to reduce verification complexity by facilitating compositional reasoning and verification reuse.

Many works have analyzed its security, identifying flaws and often suggesting fixes, thus helping the protocol's evolution. Several recent results present successful formal-methods-based verification of a significant portion of the current version 5, and some even imply security in the computational setting. For these results to hold, encryption in Kerberos should satisfy strong cryptographic security notions. However, neither currently deployed as part of Kerberos encryption schemes nor their proposed revisions are known to provably satisfy such notions. We take a close look at Kerberos' encryption and confirm that most of the options in the current version provably provide privacy and authenticity, some with slight modification that we suggest. Our results complement the formal-methods-based analysis of Kerberos that justifies its current design. \&copy; 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {At Crypto '06, Bellare presented new security proofs for HMAC and NMAC, under the assumption that the underlying compression function is a pseudo-random function family. Conversely, at Asi- acrypt '06, Contini and Yin used collision techniques to obtain forgery and partial key-recovery attacks on HMAC and NMAC instantiated with MD4, MD5, SHA-0 and reduced SHA-1. In this paper, we present the first full key-recovery attacks on NMAC and HMAC instantiated with a real-life hash function, namely MD4. Our main result is an attack on HMAC/NMAC-MD4 which recovers the full MAC secret key after roughly 288 MAC queries and 295 MD4 computations. We also extend the partial key-recovery Contini-Yin attack on NMAC-MD5 (in the related- key setting) to a full key-recovery attack. The attacks are based on generalizations of collision attacks to recover a secret IV, using new differential paths for MD4.},

abstract = {Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are core algorithms deployed in virtually every security protocol in common usage. In these protocols, the integrity and authenticity of messages rely entirely on the security of the MAC; we examine cases in which this security is lost. In this paper, we examine the notion of "reforgeability" for MACs, and motivate its utility in the context of \{power, bandwidth, CPU\}-constrained computing environments. We first give a definition for this new notion, then examine some of the most widely-used and well-known MACs under our definition in a variety of adversarial settings, finding in nearly all cases a failure to meet the new notion. We examine simple counter-measures to increase resistance to reforgeabiliy, using state and truncating the tag length, but find that both are not simultaneously applicable to modern MACs. In response, we give a tight security reduction for a new MAC, WMAC, which we argue is the "best fit" for resource-limited devices.},

Analysis of such problem educes that it must combine the counter mode encryption with the hash tree based authentication, and such combination must inosculate with the architecture characters of SMP system to decrease additional burdens. Protecting method mainly consists of: (1) associate each data with its MAC and IV to form a (data, MAC, IV) pair, and the un-tampered IV can ensure data to be un-broken; (2) generate IV through tracing the shared bus sequence number, to complete bus data protection; (3) check the stored IV by hash tree, to realize memory data protection; (4) build the entire hash tree into MCH, to eliminate synchronization of tree root among processors; (5) spread tree root authentication result from MCH to processors through the safeguard IV-channel, to connect bus protection and memory protection smoothly to avoid introducing any additional data re-encryption/re-authentication on data path. Other optimizing measures are also applied. Simulations inspect this method, and prove that it is an efficient way to construct SMP data protection system.},

abstract = {With more embedded systems networked, it becomes an important problem to effectively defend embedded systems against buffer overflow attacks. Due to the increasing complexity and strict requirements, off-the-shelf software components are widely used in embedded systems, especially for military and other critical applications. Therefore, in addition to effective protection, we also need to provide an approach for system integrators to efficiently check whether software components have been protected. In this paper, we propose the HSDefender (Hardware/Software Defender) technique to perform protection and checking together. Our basic idea is to design secure call instructions so systems can be secured and checking can be easily performed. In the paper, we classify buffer overflow attacks into two categories and provide two corresponding defending strategies. We analyze the HSDefender technique with respect to hardware cost, security, and performance. We experiment with our HSDefender technique on the simplescalar/ARM simulator with benchmarks from MiBench, an embedded benchmark suite. The results show that our HSDefender technique can defend a system against more types of buffer overflow attacks with less overhead compared with the previous work},

In the first case, the core functionality of the operating system is trusted and implemented in a security kernel. We also describe a variant implementation assuming an untrusted operating system. AEGIS provides users with tamper-evident, authenticated environments in which any physical or software tampering by an adversary is guaranteed to be detected, and private and authenticated tamper-resistant environments where additionally the adversary is unable to obtain any information about software or data by tampering with, or otherwise observing, system operation. AEGIS enables many applications, such as commercial grid computing, secure mobile agents, software licensing, and digital rights management.

abstract = {In today's digital world, computer security issues have become increasingly important. In particular, researchers have proposed designs for secure processors which utilize hardware-based memory encryption and integrity verification to protect the privacy and integrity of computation even from sophisticated physical attacks. However, currently proposed schemes remain hampered by problems that make them impractical for use in today's computer systems: lack of virtual memory and inter-process communication support as well as excessive storage and performance overheads. In this paper, we propose 1) address independent seed encryption (AISE), a counter-mode based memory encryption scheme using a novel seed composition, and 2) Bonsai Merkle trees (BMT), a novel Merkle tree-based memory integrity verification technique, to eliminate these system and performance issues associated with prior counter-mode memory encryption and Merkle tree integrity verification schemes. We present both a qualitative discussion and a quantitative analysis to illustrate the advantages of our techniques over previously proposed approaches in terms of complexity, feasibility, performance, and storage. Our results show that AISE+BMT reduces the overhead of prior memory encryption and integrity verification schemes from 12\% to 2\% on average, while eliminating critical system-level problems.},

abstract = {As cryptographic proofs have become essentially unverifiable, cryptographers have argued in favor of developing techniques that help tame the complexity of their proofs. Game-based techniques provide a popular approach in which proofs are structured as sequences of games, and in which proof steps establish the validity of transitions between successive games. Code-based techniques form an instance of this approach that takes a code-centric view of games, and that relies on programming language theory to justify proof steps. While code-based techniques contribute to formalize the security statements precisely and to carry out proofs systematically, typical proofs are so long and involved that formal verification is necessary to achieve a high degree of confidence. We present CertiCrypt, a framework that enables the machine-checked construction and verification of code-based proofs. CertiCrypt is built upon the general-purpose proof assistant Coq, and draws on many areas, including probability, complexity, algebra, and semantics of programming languages. CertiCrypt provides certified tools to reason about the equivalence of probabilistic programs, including a relational Hoare logic, a theory of observational equivalence, verified program transformations, and game-based techniques such as reasoning about failure events. The usefulness of CertiCrypt is demonstrated through various examples, including a proof of semantic security of OAEP (with a bound that improves upon existing published results), and a proof of existential unforgeability of FDH signatures. Our work provides a first yet significant step towards Halevi's ambitious programme of providing tool support for cryptographic proofs. Copyright\&copy; 2009 ACM.},

The attacks use a substantial number of verification queries but eventually allow for universal forgeries instead of existential or multiple forgeries. This means that the security of the algorithms completely collapses once a few forgeries are found. Some of these attacks start off by exploiting a weak key property, but turn out to become full-fledged divide and conquer attacks because of the specific structure of the universal hash functions considered. Partial information on a secret key can be exploited too, in the sense that it renders some key recovery attacks practical as soon as a few key bits are known. These results show that while universal hash functions offer provable security, high speeds and parallelism, their simple combinatorial properties make them less robust than conventional message authentication primitives.},

abstract = {The subject of this paper is the security analysis of soft verification. Soft verification is used, when messages protected by Message Authentication Codes (MAC) are transmitted over the noisy channel without Automatic Re-peat Request (ARQ) protocol. This situation is given with the secure real-time, satellite or broadband communication. Forward Error Correction (FEC) Codes are able to correct many errors, but not all of them. These remaining errors disable a successful authentication of messages protected by MACs. Many applications, multimedia or biometric for example, would accept messages with a few or local errors. Therefore, an authentication method is requested, which accepts messages as authentic, although they would be rejected by the standard verification. Such a method is supported by soft authentication. Two groups of soft authentication algorithms will be described: algorithms, which generate error tolerant MACs, whose security aspects were already published, and an soft verification, based on soft decision decoding, whose security aspects have not yet been published. The security level of soft verified messages is reduced. The risk of forgery and security loss will be calculated. Formulas will be presented for the extension of the lengths of MACs to compensate for the reduction of the security level. Results show remarkable coding gains. Many more messages can be accepted as authentic by soft verification at the same security level compared to standard verification without soft verification. \&copy; 2012 IEEE.},

The memory management unit which provides multitasking and virtual memory support is extended and given a third purpose: to supply strong hardware security support for the software layer. The principle of this enhanced device, that we call a Security Management Unit (or SMU), is based on ciphered program execution and access control. It is composed of a pipelined block ciphering/deciphering unit, an infernal permanent memory and logic control, whose interaction is explained in this paper},

This method is a pervasively used international and U.S. standard. We provide its first formal justification, showing the following general lemma: that cipher block chaining a pseudorandom function gives a pseudorandom function. Underlying our results is a technical lemma of independent interest, bounding the success probability of a computationally unbounded adversary in distinguishing between a random ml-bit to l-bit function and the CBC MAC of a random l-bit to l-bit function.},

Our constructions use three keys, K1, K2, K3, to avoid unnecessary padding and MAC any message M\&epsiv;\{0,1\}* using max\{1,[|M|/n]\} applications of the underlying n-bit block cipher. Our favorite construction, XCBC, works like this: if |M| is a positive multiple of n then XOR the n-bit key K2 with the last block of M and compute the CBC MAC keyed with K1; otherwise, extend M's length to the next multiple of n by appending minimal 10i padding (i\&ges;0), XOR the n-bit key K3 with the last block of the padded message, and compute the CBC MAC keyed with K1. We prove the security of this and other constructions, giving concrete bounds on an adversary's inability to forge in terms of her inability to distinguish the block cipher from a random permutation. Our analysis exploits new ideas which simplify proofs compared to prior work},

abstract = {Due to the widespread software piracy and virus attacks, significant efforts have been made to improve security for computer systems. For stand-alone computers, a key observation is that other than the processor, any component is vulnerable to security attacks. Recently, an execution only memory (XOM) architecture has been proposed to support copy and tamper resistant software by D. Lie et al. (2000), D. Lie et al. (2003) and T. Gilmont et al. (1999). In this design, the program and data are stored in encrypted format outside the CPU boundary. The decryption is carried after they are fetched from memory, and before they are used by the CPU. As a result, the lengthened critical path causes a serious performance degradation. In this paper, we present an innovative technique in which the cryptography computation is shifted off from the memory access critical path. We propose to use a different encryption scheme, namely "one-time pad" encryption, to produce the instructions and data ciphertext. With some additional on-chip storage, cryptography computations are carried in parallel with memory accesses, minimizing performance penalty. We performed experiments to study the trade-off between storage size and performance penalty. Our technique improves the execution speed of the XOM architecture by 34\% at maximum},

We analyze its security and performance, and show that it is the most efficient mode of operation for high speed packet networks, by using a realistic model of a network crypto module and empirical data from studies of Internet traffic in conjunction with software experiments and hardware designs. GCM has several useful features: it can accept IVs of arbitrary length, can act as a stand-alone message authentication code (MAC), and can be used as an incremental MAC. We show that GCM is secure in the standard model of concrete security, even when these features are used. We also consider several of its important system-security aspects},

We believe that having all five of these properties makes CWC a powerful tool for use in many performance-critical cryptographic applications. CWC is also the first appropriate solution for some applications; e.g., standardization bodies like the IETF and NIST prefer patent-free modes, and CWC is the first such mode capable of processing data at 10 Gbit/s in hardware, which will be important for future IPsec (and other) network devices. As part of our design, we also introduce a new parallelizable universal hash function optimized for performance in both hardware and software},

abstract = {With the increasing concern of the security on high performance multiprocessor enterprise servers, more and more effort is being invested into defending against various kinds of attacks. This paper proposes a security enhancement model called SENSS, that allows programs to run securely on a symmetric shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) environment. In SENSS, a program, including both code and data, is stored in the shared memory in encrypted form but is decrypted once it is fetched into any of the processors. In contrast to the traditional uniprocessor XOM model (Lie et al., 2000), the main challenge in developing SENSS lies in the necessity for guarding the clear text communication between processors in a multiprocessor environment. In this paper we propose an inexpensive solution that can effectively protect the shared bus communication. The proposed schemes include both encryption and authentication for bus transactions. We develop a scheme that utilizes the cipher block chaining mode of the advanced encryption standard (CBC-AES) to achieve ultra low latency for the shared bus encryption and decryption. In addition, CBC-AES can generate integrity checking code for the bus communication over time, achieving bus authentication. Further, we develop techniques to ensure the cryptographic computation throughput meets the high bandwidth of gigabyte buses. We performed full system simulation using Simics to measure the overhead of the security features on a SMP system with a snooping write invalidate cache coherence protocol. Overall, only a slight performance degradation of 2.03\% on average was observed when the security is provided at the highest level},

abstract = {We present a new variant of PMAC (Parallelizable Message Authentication Code). The new mode calls an n-bit block cipher using four different block-cipher keys but attains a security bound of a novel form O(q2/2n + \&lscr;$\sigma$q/22n). Here, q denotes the total number of queries, \&lscr; the maximum length of each query (in blocks), and $\sigma$ the total query complexity (in blocks). Our bound improves over the previous PMAC security O(\&lscr;q2/2n) from FSE 2007 and over O($\sigma$q/2n) from FSE 2010. Moreover, when \&lscr; > 2n/6, our bound holds valid for larger values of q than the beyond-birthday bound O(\&lscr;3q3/22n) does-the bound of the PMAC variant from CRYPTO 2011. In particular, our bound becomes “\&lscr;-free” as O(q2/2n) under the condition that all queries are shorter than 2n/2 blocks (i.e., \&lscr; \&les; 2n/2). Our construction is fairly efficient; it runs at rate 2/3 (meaning 1.5 encryptions to process n bits), which can be made even faster by increasing the number of keys. Thus our construction brings substantial gain in security guarantee without much loss in efficiency, which becomes especially valuable for 64-bit block ciphers.},
